# Odin-TestingPractice

A JavaScript testing practice project from **The Odin Project**’s JavaScript path. This repo includes solutions and unit tests for common exercise functions, demonstrating best practices in writing clean, predictable code using Jest.

## ​ Project Overview

This repository contains:

- Core implementations of utility functions:
    - `capitalize.js` – capitalizes the first character of a string
    - `reverseString.js` – reverses a string
    - `calculator.js` – an object providing basic math operations (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
    - `caesarCipher.js` – shifts letters by a given factor, preserving case and skipping non-alphabetic characters
    - `analyzeArray.js` – accepts an array of numbers and returns an object with `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`
- Test files for each exercise located in the `__tests__` folder
- Setup for Jest with Babel to allow using ES6 modules
